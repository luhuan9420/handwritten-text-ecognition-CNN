# handwritten-text-ecognition-CNN

A handwritten text recognition machin that is implemented by using the Covolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with 3 different datasets: MNIST, EMNIST, and CASIA-HWDB. The CNN model is built by using TensorFlow and Keras in Python.

The result show that MNIST dataset reaches the highest accuracy and have the simplest model; EMNIST achieves an 87.53% accuracy, but it can 
be improved if the model is trained for more epochs; CASIA-HWDB only reaches 42.5% accuracy in testing images due to the limited number of samples for each character in the test image set. 

One major conclusion from the project is that complex models do not mean better accuracy. Complex models might diverge while training. Sometimes, a simpler model can reach a better accuracy. In the future, the model can be trained for more epochs to determine whether the models improve or implemented and trained with different types of neural and test if it will achieve better accuracy.

Here is the poster I made that summarize the project
